# Visualizing-Survey-Data-with-Seaborn

This project visualizes synthetic survey data using Python libraries such as *Pandas, **Seaborn, and **Matplotlib*. The goal is to highlight trends in satisfaction levels and opinions across different departments using insightful charts.


## Problem Statement

Analyze survey data using visualizations to highlight key trends and opinions.

## Expected Outcomes:
- Countplot: Distribution of response types
- Pie Chart: Distribution of satisfaction levels (1‚Äì5)
- Bar Plot: Average satisfaction rating per department

üßæ Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a self-generated CSV file with 1000 entries, simulating survey responses. It contains the following columns:

| Column           | Description                                      |

| Department     | Department name (e.g., HR, IT, Marketing, etc.)  |
| SatisfactionLevel | Satisfaction rating on a scale of 1 to 5      |
| ResponseType   | Overall response sentiment: Positive, Neutral, Negative |

 üìä Visualizations

The project includes the following visualizations:

1. **Response Count by Type
   - Shows how many respondents are Positive, Neutral, or Negative
2. Pie Chart of Satisfaction Levels
   - Displays percentage distribution across 1‚Äì5 rating levels
3. Bar Chart of Avg. Satisfaction per Department
   - Highlights which departments are performing better in satisfaction
